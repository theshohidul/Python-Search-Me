# Python - Search Me (a simple json based dictionary)

`Search Me` is a simple json based dictionary app, made by using python programming language for my learning purpose. I have used `dictionary.json` file as the source file. My main focus of this project is to understand some basics of python programming language as a beginner.

# Features
  - User can search a word and get the result.
  - If the word doesn't found in the dictionary, a message is shown.
